# R-Empirical-Real-Estate

Author: Marco Hassan 

Semester exercise for a lecture in Empirical Real Estate Finance at the University of St. Gallen.

The goal is to apply standard statistical techniques and spatial regressions to dataset involving real estate properties and to map them accordingly through the leaflet package.

# Assignment 1

This assignment reports basics statistics for a series of USA properties.

Moreover in the code I get coordinates for Swiss properties through the ggmap package using google databases and given that I plot the properties in Switzerland accordingly to the property size.

# Assignment 2

This assignment uses the Melbourne dataset available on Kaggle under the following link.

___________________________________________________________

Based on that I run a hedonic regression to understand the most determinant factors determining the price in Melbourne city.

Based on the lm package I explore the assumption for a BLUE OLS estimator.

Finally I plot the price in the city through the leaflet package that allows to zoom in the area and move among quartiers.
